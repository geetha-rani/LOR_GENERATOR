# LOR_GENERATOR

The main purpose of this project is to create a website similar to VTOP where student can
request for a letter of recommendation letter which is needed for higher studies and from the
other side, faculty can accept his/her request and can send it to the student via email. Due to
the pandemic it is not easy to go around the college and wait for and get it. So, in this project
we aim to create an option in the website portal where the student who needs an LOR can
apply for it from their student login portal, and also they can choose the faculty according to
their convince from whom they need the LOR .This being an open-source project, we will be
using ***Html, CSS for frontend and PHP and MySQL for backend***. We have also included
features like updating password for both faculty and student, created a record of the faculty
profile and student profile and update it now and then for the updated marks and timetable
which is useful for both the student and faculty. Here we used mpdf library which is going to
generate pdf files from the html templates & the composed tool is used to declare the library
and allowed us to install it.
